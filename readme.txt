= Features of the framework =

This plugin uses the SL framework. This framework eases the creation of new plugins by providing incredible tools and frames.

For instance, a new created plugin comes with

* A translation interface to simplify the localization of the text of the plugin ; 
* An embedded SVN client (subversion) to easily commit/update the plugin in wordpress.org repository ; 
* A detailled documentation of all available classes and methodes ; 
* etc.

Have fun !
